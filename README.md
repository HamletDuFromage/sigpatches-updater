## FAQ

### What are sigpatches
Sigpatches allow your Switch to install and run unofficial NSP file (digital titles that appear on the home menu). \
Note that you must use CFW to launch these applications even after installation as sigpatches are always required to do so.

### Which sigpatches should I chose?
If you're entering Atmosphere by injecting the \"fusee-primary.bin\" payload, download the appropriate sigpatches. If you're using Hekatee and \"fss0\", get the Hekate sigpatches.

### Where do those sigpatches come from?
The sigpatches are, as of now, pulled directly from the Gbatemp threads. You can find the links the homebrew uses [here](https://hamletdufromage.github.io/sigpatches-updater/sigpatches.html). Because those links are updated with a cron job, the links might be down for a little bit right after new sigpatches are uploaded to Gbatemp. If this persists and the links remain broken please open an issue and i'll investigate.

### Legality?
Please use only sigpatches to install backups of games you own, or homebrew applications you are allowed to install. Using sigpatches is legal, and I am not hosting sigpatches myself. This tool merely automates a process that is routinely done by thousands of Switch owners.
